# Artistic Skyrim Overhaul - Fixed

## How to use ?

Get [Synthesis](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/wiki) and add the patcher to your patcher list.
Or run the standalone .exe found on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53955) and here.

You need to have the resources mod found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53955), as it contains the normal map texture all needed texture sets get linked to by this patcher.

And you need to have [Artistic Skyrim Overhaul - No More Reflective Surfaces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40574) installed as it fixes all the interiors.

## What gets fixed ?

This fixes broken landscape and snow renders caused by changes made to Skyrim SE that make LE Textures not work well with it.
